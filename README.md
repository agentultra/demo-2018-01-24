# demo-2018-01-24

Cheated a little today... not actually at the laundromat.

Never the less, the wireless was off, and there was nobody else around.

Trying out a better way to manage/mutate state.

- Time to first interaction: _12 mins_
- Total time: _25 mins_

# Controls

_W, S, A, D_ to move around.

Bumping into the square attacks it.

# Goal

Kill the red square. Bump into it enough times and it dies. The end.
